# Titanic-Survival-Analysis

# 🛳️ Titanic Survival EDA

This repository contains Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to understand the factors influencing passenger survival. The project explores demographic and travel-related variables to uncover patterns and insights.

---

## 📊 Objectives
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
- Analyze survival rates based on key features
- Visualize patterns using Python libraries
- Derive meaningful insights from the dataset

---

## ✅ Key Analysis Steps
- Imported dataset & inspected structure
- Checked and handled missing values
- Renamed and cleaned features
- Visualizized survival trends based on:
  - Gender
  - Passenger class
  - Age distribution
  - Family Size

---

## 🧠 Insights
- Females had a higher survival rate than males
- Passengers in **1st class** survived more than 2nd & 3rd
- Younger passengers had better chances of survival
- Traveling with family slightly increased survival probability
